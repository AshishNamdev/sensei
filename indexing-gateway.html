  <h2>Indexing &amp; Gateway</h2>
  <p>This section describes how data are inserted into Sensei.</p>
</div>

<h2>Data Events</h2>
<p>
  Data events are units of indexing activities. Each data event is a tuple of (type,data,version). (versions are interpreted by Gateway semantics)
</p>
<p>
  Types of data events:
  <ul>
    <li>add (default) - inserts data into Sensei</li>
    <li>delete - deletes data from Sensei</li>
    <li>update - update partially on an existing event</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h2>Examples of data events</h2>
<p>
<h4>Add event:</h4>
<pre class="prettyprint" id="javascript">
{"type":"add","data":{"id":1,"contents":"sensei is cool","attrib":"opensource"}}
</pre>
<p>since add is the default event type, this is equivalent to:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint" id="javascript">
{"id":1,"contents":"sensei is cool","attrib":"opensource"}
</pre>
<p>for add events with the same id, newer events overwrite existing events</p>
</p>

<p>
<h4>Update event:</h4>
<pre class="prettyprint" id="javascript">
{"type":"update","data":{"id":1,"attrib":"data system"}}
</pre>
<p>update events assume there is an existing event with the same id in the system. If no such event exists, this event will result in an error.</p>
</p>


<p>
<h4>Delete event:</h4>
<pre class="prettyprint" id="javascript">
{"type":"delete","id":1}
</pre>
<p>If no such event exists, this event is a no-op.</p>
</p>

<h2>Data Stream</h2>
<p>
  Stream of data events that Sensei consumes from via Gateways.
</p>
<p>
  Some properties of Data Streams:
<ul>
	<li>Versioned - each event on the stream has a monotonically increasing value indicating a unique point in the stream</li>
	<li>Ordered - ordering of all events should reflect the semantics of the application</li>
</ul> 	
</p>

<p>
  Some examples of data streams:
  <ul>
    <li>Twitter stream</li>
    <li>Activity tracking data, e.g. LinkedIn profile creation and update events</li>
    <li>Server logs</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h2>Gateway</h2>
<p>
  Gateways are integration components between Sensei and Data Streams. Gateways serve the following purposes:
  <ul>
    <li>Read data events from data streams and proxy between Sensei and the data stream</li>
    <li>Interpret version semantics of data events read from the data stream</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>The following diagram illustrates how gateways fit into Sensei:</p>

<p>
  Sensei comes with the following pre-written gateways:
  <ul>
    <li>File - each line is a data event, and line number is the version</li>
    <li>JMS - each message is a data event, <code>System.nanoTime()</code> is used as version</li>
    <li>JDBC - each element in the ResultSet is a data event, developer implements version semantics</li>
    <li>Kafka - each message is a data event, and offset is the version</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h2>Batch indexing</h2>
