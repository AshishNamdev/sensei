<h2>Why did Sensei model Rest API after ElasticSearch Query DSL</h2>
<p>
  Aside from a few differences that are specific to Sensei, the Sensei Rest API is largely inspired by <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/query-dsl/">ElasticSearch&apos;s Query DSL</a>. ElasticSearch&apos;s Query DSL is very well designed in exposing <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/java/3_4_0/api/core/org/apache/lucene/search/Query.html">Lucene&apos;s query</a> capabilities and features in an elegant way. We didn&apos;t think it was necessary to create yet another API that is completely different.
</p>
<p>
  We have been engaging in dialogs with the ElasticSearch team in standardizing on a common API.
